'''
1. No spaces inbetween variable name [It has to be a single unit]
2. Variable names CANNOT start with Numbers like 3length
3. Names of the FUNCTIONS can't be used as Variable names like print, input
4. The variable names have to be CONSISTENT throughout the code like you can't define 'name' and later ask to print 'nama'.
