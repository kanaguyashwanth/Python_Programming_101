CHARMING FEATURES OF PYCHARM:

Text Editor vs. IDE:
- Spell Check
- Applies rule and guidances like Indentation
- Style Guide (Yellow-squiggly lines)
- Local History (Reverting to Snapshots)
- View Structure (all variables, all functions) [Structure-pane]
- Refactor Rename (BETTER than find and replace! Suppose there's a print statment with a text which you don't wanna change, the factor will not change it.)
    - Right-click name of function or variable
    - Change the name (changes it everywhere!)
    - Click refactor ---> Click Do Refactor
